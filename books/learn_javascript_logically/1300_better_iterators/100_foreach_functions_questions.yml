    ```javascript

    The forEach() function is used to iterate over the sacredTetrad array and append the square of every number to the result array.

    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var fun = ["dance", "party"];
    var bang = function (x) {
      console.log(x + "!");
    }
    fun.forEach(bang);
    ```

    <pre>
    dance!
    party!
    </pre>

    The forEach() function iterates over every element in the fun array and calls the anonymous function that is assigned to the bang variable.  The following code yields an equivalent result:

    ```javascript
    bang("dance");
    bang("party");
    ```
