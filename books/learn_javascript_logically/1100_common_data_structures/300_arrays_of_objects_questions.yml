    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var cat = {
      name: "garfield",
      mood: "blah"
    }

    var crazy = {
      name: "rambo",
      mood: "angry"
    }

    var random = [cat, crazy];

    for (var i = 0; i < random.length; i++) {
      var thing = random[i];
      console.log(thing.name + " is " + thing.mood);
    }
    ```

    <pre>
    garfield is blah
    rambo is angry
    </pre>

    The for loop iterates through every element in the random array and prints a message to the console.

    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var testOne = {
      score: 63,
      date: "2015-01-04"
    }

    var testTwo = {
      score: 85,

    }

    var testThree = {
      score: 74,
      date: "2015-05-10"
    }

    var tests = [testOne, testTwo, testThree];

    var countPassingTests = 0;

    for (var i = 0; i < tests.length; i++) {
      var test = tests[i];
      if (test.score > 65) {
        countPassingTests++;
      }
    }

    console.log(countPassingTests);
    ```

    The for loop iterates over all the tests and increments the countPassingTests variable whenever the score is greater than 65.  The countPassingTests variable is then printed to the console.
