# Modulus Operator

The modulus operator (%) finds the remainder after the division of two numbers.  For example, 3 divided by two results in a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1.

```javascript
console.log(3 % 2); // 1
```

11 divided by 4 results in a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 3.

```javascript
console.log(11 % 4); // 3
```

All even numbers have a remainder of 0 when they're divided by 2.

```javascript
4 % 2; // 0
6 % 2; // 0
8 % 2; // 0
10 % 2; // 0
```

All odd numbers have a reminder of 1 when they're divided by 2.

```javascript
5 % 2; // 1
7 % 2; // 1
9 % 2; // 1
11 % 2; // 1
```

The modulus operator is a great way to determine if a number is odd or even.
