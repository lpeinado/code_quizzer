    Numbers with decimal points (e.g. 4.4, 1.8) are called floating point numbers. Computers cannot do math with floating point numbers precisely, which is why the answer is slightly different from 1.

    Integers are numbers without decimal points (e.g. 5 and 5,397). Computers can do math with integers precisely.
