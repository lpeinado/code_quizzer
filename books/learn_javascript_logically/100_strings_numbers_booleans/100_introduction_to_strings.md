# Introduction to Strings

Strings are a JavaScript type to store text values like `"bob"` or `'I like cheese'`.

Strings can be created with single or double quotes.

```javascript
"this is a string"
'this is a string, too'
```
When a number is surrounded by single or double quotes, it is actually a string!

```javascript
'3'
"4.32"
```

Strings can be combined using the plus operator (+). This is called string concatenation.

```javascript
console.log("bat" + "man"); // prints "batman" to the console
```

The `length` property returns the number of characters in a string.

```javascript
console.log("coolio".length); // prints 6 to the console
```

The "coolio" string has 6 letters so the length is 6.
