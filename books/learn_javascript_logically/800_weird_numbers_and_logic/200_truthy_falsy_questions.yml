    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var party = "dance";
    while (party) {
      console.log("woo hoo!");
      party = "";
    }
    ```

    woo hoo!

    The party variable is initially assigned to the string "dance" which is truthy in a boolean context.  After the first iteration, the party variable is reassigned to the empty string, which is falsy, so the while loop is exited.
