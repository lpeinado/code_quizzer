    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var lol;
    var zyz;
    console.log(lol);
    ```

    undefined

    The variable lol is declared but is not assigned to any value.  When variables are declared but not assigned to a value, they are automatically assigned to undefined.

    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    function fullName(x, y) {
      x + " " + y;
    }
    console.log(fullName("Mr", "Powers"));
    ```
  answer: |2

    undefined

    The fullName() function does not use the return keyword, so nothing is returned from the function.  JavaScript returns undefined from a function when the return keyword does not specify a return value.
