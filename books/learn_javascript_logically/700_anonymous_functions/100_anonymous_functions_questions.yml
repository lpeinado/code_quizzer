    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var beHappy = function() {
      console.log("just chill");
    }
    ```
    console.log(beHappy);
  answer: |2

    ```javascript
    function() {
      console.log("just chill");
    }
    ```

    The beHappy variable is assigned to a function.  It is a common mistake to forget the parentheses when invoking a function â€” that is, writing beHappy instead of beHappy().  If you call beHappy without parentheses, the computer returns the function itself rather than its result.

    If you want to print the result of the function, you would need to invoke it inside the console.log statement like so:

    ```javascript
    console.log(beHappy()); // "just chill"
    ```
