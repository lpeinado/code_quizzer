    Is the following loop an infinite loop? Explain why/why not.

    ```javascript
    x = 4;
    while (x === 4) {
      console.log("will I terminate?");
    }
    ```
  answer: |2

    This is an infinite loop because the boolean condidion (4 === 4) always evaluates to true.

    Is the following loop an infinite loop? Explain why/why not.

    ```javascript
    var counter = 0;
    while (counter < 4) {
      console.log("give me chicken");
    }
    ```

    The counter variable is assigned to 0 and is never reassigned, so the boolean condition (0 < 4) always evaluates to true.  The loop continues forever.

    Is the following loop an infinite loop? Explain why/why not.

    ```javascript
    var counter = 0;
    var i = 0;
    while (counter < 100) {
      console.log("I like Indian food");
      i++;
    }
    ```

    Yes, this is an infinite loop.

    The i variable is incremented for each loop iteration, but the counter variable is unchanged, so the boolean condition is always true.  The loop iterates forever.
