    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var arrestedDev = ["tobias", "michael", "gob"];
    console.log(arrestedDev[arrestedDev.length - 1]);
    ```

    gob

    The arrestedDev array has three elements, so the length property returns 3.  The length of an array minus one equals the index position of the last element in the array :)
