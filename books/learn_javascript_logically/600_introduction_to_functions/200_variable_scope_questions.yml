    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var x = "sky";
    function moon() {
      return("I live in the " + x);
    }
    console.log(moon());
    ```

    I live in the sky

    Because the variable x is defined outside a function, it is accessible anywhere — including inside any function (such as moon()).  The variable x is accessible within the moon() function, so the expression ``"I live in the " + x` returns the string `"I live in the sky"`.

    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    function pretty() {
      var look = "hipsters";
      return("I like " + look);
    }
    console.log(look);
    ```

    This code raises an exception.  The look variable is defined within the pretty() function and is only accessible within that function.  The look variable exists only in the context of the pretty() function itself — console.log(pretty()) would still print "I like hipsters."

    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var coolCat = "garfield";
    function meow() {
      return(coolCat + " likes lasagna");
    }
    console.log(meow());
    console.log(coolCat);
    ```
  answer: |2

    garfield likes lasagna
    garfield

    The coolCat variable is assigned to the "garfield" string and can be used within the meow() function.  The coolCat variable can also be used outside of the meow() function.
