# Variable Scope

Variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function.  The following code will raise an error.

```javascript
function nothing() {
  var y = 24;
  return(y);
}
nothing() // this works because the nothing() function can access the y variable
console.log(y) // this raises and error because the y variable cannot be accessed outside the nothing() function
```

The y variable is accessible within the nothing() function, but access to this variable is lost once the function is over.

By contrast, variables defined before the function are accessible within the function.

```javascript
var greatBand = "Backstreet";
function important() {
  return(greatBand + " Boys");
}
console.log(important()); // "Backstreet Boys"
```

The greatBand variable is defined before the important() function and is accessible within the important() function.

The greatBand variable is still available after the function definition and invocation:

```javascript
console.log(greatBand); // "Backstreet"
```

In summary, variables defined outside functions are accessible both inside and outside of functions.  Variables that are defined within a function are only accessible within that function.
