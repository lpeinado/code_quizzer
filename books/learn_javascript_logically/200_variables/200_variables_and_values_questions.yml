    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var gg = 4;
    var ll = 4;
    console.log(gg === ll);
    ```
  answer: |2

    ```javascript
    true
    ```

    The gg and ll variables are both assigned to the value 4.  The === operator returns true when both of the operands are the same.  In this example, gg and ll are the operands and === is the operator.
