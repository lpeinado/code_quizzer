    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var blah = "meh";
    var motivation = "super!!!";
    blah = motivation;
    console.log(blah);
    ```

    "super!!!"

    The blah variable is initially assigned to the "meh" string.  The motivation variable is initially assigned to the "super!!!" string.  blah is then reassigned to the same value that motivation is assigned to (e.g. blah is reassigned to "super!!!").
