# Variable Practice

We've already covered basic mathematical operations:

```javascript
4 + 5 // returns 9
```

Variables can be used in place of values when performing mathematical operations:

```javascript
var firstNumber = 4;
var secondNumber = 5;
firstNumber + secondNumber // returns 9
```

Strings can also be combined with the `+` operator. This is called string concatenation:

```javascript
"Bart" + " Simpson" // returns "Bart Simpson"
```

Multiple strings can be concatenated:

```javascript
"Bart " + "JoJo" + " Simpson" // returns "Bart JoJo Simpson"
```

Variables can also be used with string concatenation:

```javascript
var first = "Homer";
var last = "Simpson";
first + " " + last // "Homer Simpson"
```
