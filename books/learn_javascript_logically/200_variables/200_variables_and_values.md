# Variables and Values

Variables are assigned to values. After variables are assigned, they can be reassigned to other values.

```javascript
var world; // the variable world is declared
world = "pretty"; // world is assigned to the value "pretty"
world = 20; // world is reassigned to the value 20
````

Different variables can be assigned to the same value;

```javascript
var world = "awesome";
var waterfall = "awesome";
world === waterfall // true
````

You can assign variables to any type of value. Numbers (`45`), strings (`"something"`), and booleans `true` are all valid examples.

In the following statement, the variable `mood` is assigned to the value `'happy'`:

```javascript
var mood = 'happy';
```

In the following statement, the variable `bestNumber` is assigned to the value `8`:

```javascript
var bestNumber = 8;
```

In the following statement, the variable `isCorrect` is assigned to the value `false`:

```javascript
var isCorrect = false;
```
